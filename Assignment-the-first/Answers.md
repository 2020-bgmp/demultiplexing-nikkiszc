| 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz |  |
| 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz |  |
| 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz |  |
| 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz |  |

## Part 2
1. Define the problem

```
We want to de-multiplex the four fastq files we are given, 
meaning that we want to separate the different libraries into their own files.
```

2. Describe output

```

```

3. Upload your [4 input FASTQ files](../TEST-input_FASTQ) and your [4 expected output FASTQ files](../TEST-output_FASTQ).

4. Pseudocode

```See file named pseudocode.txt.```

5. High level functions. For each function, be sure to include:
    1. Description/doc string
    2. Function headers (name and parameters)
    3. Test examples for individual functions
    4. Return statement
    
```This is all included in my pseudocode.```
